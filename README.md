# PlayWithQuizQuestion

As part of my recent work, I developed the back-end for a quiz application using Spring Boot. The application allows users tocreate new quizzes and evaluate their performance. Instead of relying on a front-end UI, we utilized Postman for quiz creation and answering questions. The back-end handles CRUD operations, manages quiz data, and stores correct answers in a MySQL database. This project showcased my skills in back- end development, Rest-API design, and database management.
